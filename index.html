Major said, "Come out tonight"
New townhome on the Houston side
Didn't know I'd meet a spark
In a stranger with those lion eyes

You walked in, heat in the room
Persian boy in vintage shoes
They said you made… films of a kind
But it wasn't that — just rumors, right?

It started with cheap wine and louder laughs
Plastic cups and stories we half-assed
Didn't know your name would mean this much
But the night lit up when you showed up
That housewarming heartbeat, the start of the flame
I never saw it coming, but I'm so glad it came

You were moving in with Sadiq and Andrew
I was crashing in, just passing through
Major's the thread we didn't see
Till we three made our little trinity

We danced like fools on tile floors
Told secrets we'd forgotten by four
The night was ours, no script, no plan
And somehow, that's where it all began

It started with cheap wine and louder laughs
Plastic cups and stories we half-assed
Didn't know your name would mean this much
But the night lit up when you showed up
That housewarming heartbeat, the start of the flame
I never saw it coming, but I'm so glad it came

Looking back, we were just kids in disguise
Thinking this was just a night, not a lifelong ride
But something stuck between the lines
The joke, the glance, the borrowed time

It started with cheap wine and louder laughs
Plastic cups and stories we half-assed
Didn't know your name would mean this much
But the night lit up when you showed up
That housewarming heartbeat, the start of the flame
And bestie, we've been burning ever since that day

He lived in a casita made of dreams and dust
Pull-ups on the porch, whole house go bust
Said he was a witch, said he'd never die
Called himself a phoenix with takka in his eye

He brought the fire, we brought the lighter
Three kings of the night, riding dirty and higher

He was yelling at stop signs, starting club fights
Screamed "Goodbye Grandma!" in the middle of the night
A mess, a riot, a spiritual guide
He made us a trinity we never denied
But not all spells stick, not all stars align
Still, our friendship outlived that wild timeline

Major broke his leg — got that check for life
Said "Don't call me dramatic, I just survived"
He'd stir the pot, then run the show
And leave us holding secrets we didn't wanna know

He danced with chaos, kissed the absurd
And called it growth with every slurred word

He was yelling at stop signs, starting club fights
Screamed "Goodbye Grandpa!" like he had the right
A witch, a phoenix, a headline on fire
The glue that cracked, the spark, the choir
But not all chaos stays, not all stories rhyme
Still, we held on through the break in time

He said, "I rise from the ashes,"
But sometimes ashes blow away
And all that's left
Is who stayed

He was yelling at stop signs, starting club fights
Living in a casita that shook every night
He brought us together, then broke the spell
But we found something deeper when the curtain fell
The trio faded, but we never burned
Real ones circle back — and we returned

He was Hef in a velvet robe
We were bunnies in our party mode
Black lace ears and cotton tails
Strutting down Montrose like fairytales

We hit up Steve for a quick fix
Phill said, "Just a little glam, no tricks"
But the flash went off — oh no, the tone
His face said winter, his neck said stone

But baby, we laughed
And we looked like gold
Even with foundation
Four shades too bold

Wrong shade, right night
Montrose lit like stage lights
We were hopping bar to bar
Like we were born for the spotlight
Flashback glam, trophy tight
We didn't blend — but we still shined bright
Wrong shade, right night
And we owned it

Socks too high, but we didn't care
Bunny Ears flying through the midnight air
Photos snapped, and the boys all stared
We were the fantasy no one dared

Meteor lit, crowd on fire
Group costume goals — entire empire
Trophy in hand, bunny in bloom
We pranced like queens in a dressing room

Wrong powder, wrong hue
But baby, our joy still matched the view

Wrong shade, right night
Montrose lit like stage lights
We were hopping bar to bar
Like we were born for the spotlight
Flashback glam, trophy tight
We didn't blend — but we still shined bright
Wrong shade, right night
And we owned it

Black bunny, white bunny,
Hef full of sweat —
The holy trinity of chaos and contour.
We didn't come to match…
We came to win.

Wrong shade, right night
Call it messy, call it right
We were beauty, we were myth
In little shorts with tails
Trophy held, smiles wide
Still laughing every time we rewind
Wrong shade, right night
And baby, we were divine

Primera vez en San Fran, qué emoción
Viernes con Jujubee, pura vibración
Un francés me miró, pero no se acercó
Yo dije, "ni modo", y la noche siguió

Pan de sopa por la bahía
Fotos lindas con alegría
Castro brillaba bajo el sol
Y en Lime empezó el descontrol

El francés me ve en la fila
Dice "ven conmigo", sin mentira
Saltamos la cola, entramos al show
Y ahí empezó todo el desmadre, bro

Domingo de escándalo, luces bajan
Los meseros bailan y nadie se queja
Bunnies en barra, ropa volando
Jesús en calzón y todos gritando
Vodka en el parque, con vasos de fiesta
Esta Pascua fue divina y bien perversa

Un chico me dice "al baño, ¿vas?"
Yo pensando, esto va a ser fugaz
Pero cierra la puerta, se baja el pantalón
Y con acento francés dice "voy a hacer popó"

Golpes en la puerta, quieren entrar
Yo aguantando el pomo para no tumbar
Sale el olor, yo con trauma facial
Pero salimos… como si nada fue mal

De ahí al Oxxo a comprar licor
Vodka barata, puro sabor
Llegamos al parque, el sol brilló
Y alguien gritó: ¡El concurso empezó!

Domingo de escándalo, luces bajan
Los meseros bailan y nadie se queja
Bunnies en barra, ropa volando
Jesús en calzón y todos gritando
Vodka en el parque, con vasos de fiesta
Esta Pascua fue divina y bien perversa

"¿Quién es el más santo… y más sexy?"
Jesús uno gira. Jesús dos perrea.
Jesús tres… se lo lleva todo.

Domingo de escándalo, nadie rezando
Pero las memorias siguen brillando
Fotos en puente, risas eternas
San Francisco… nuestras pequeñas leyendas
Vodka en el parque, con vasos de fiesta
Esta Pascua fue divina y bien perversa

He had no teeth, but had the nerve
Bones and skin, and no reserve
Drank Dr. Pepper like it was wine
Had Phill's heart — never deserved mine

Worked the bars, then played the scene
Whispers said he was… not that clean
I got flowers, he got lies
And we all watched it crash in real time

Ben 10, but really 9
Big in one way, but not in mind
Jealous stares, anxiety eyes
Screaming in the yard under neon skies
No love, just fleas and fights
Phill gave his heart, Ben gave him nights
Ben 10, but really 9
We survived, but damn — it took time

He hated me 'cause I wouldn't fold
Tried to play alpha, but just got cold
Great Dane named Colt, ate up the floor
Then pushed Phill out like love was war

People watched us through that fence
Like a drag show, just more intense
Ben was chaos, Colt was worse
And Phill got left with the hurt and the curse

Ben 10, but really 9
Big in one way, but not in mind
No kisses, no flowers, no spine
He played with strangers, crossed the line
Club secrets told us the truth
He wasn't a man, just a sleuth
Ben 10, but really 9
And porn was the final sign

Maybe he's gone
Maybe he's filming
Maybe he's dust
Or maybe just chilling
Either way —
We're fine now

Ben 10, but really 9
Phill deserved more than borrowed time
From barback lies to barking dogs
We found our way through every fog
Ben 10, but we cut the tie
No more drama, no more why
Ben 10…
But really nine.

He showed up sweet, said nothing loud
Said he had a dream to dance for the crowd
Phill just watched the storm begin
From the first blur night to the broken hinge

Tank tops tight, those diary lines
"Who is this stranger?" — but the sex was fine
Quiet boy with a neon heart
He lit up the club and then fell apart

Birthday screams and solo spins
Said "this is where my real life begins"
But every time we fought again
I broke the door — it never ends

"I just want to dance," he cried
Speaker box tears in his eyes
Dragged himself across the floor
Then ran out, then back for more
Phill was there, just sipping slow
Watching chaos steal the show
"I just want to dance," on repeat
Barefoot crying in the street

One-bedroom war, with secrets stacked
Three doors broken, never looked back
Phill and I in the awkward dawn
While Alfie packed what wasn't gone

Threw his things from the second floor
He came back like nothing before
Said "Last night was kinda fun…"
Boy, pack your stuff — the show is done

"I just want to dance," he cried
Glitter bruised and undefined
One hand waving in the dark
While I lit his dreams on fire with spark
Phill sat silent, wide-eyed, still
Watching heartbreak lose its thrill
"I just want to dance," on loop
One more twink, one more fluke

Who is this stranger I'm sleeping with?
(That's what he wrote…
but he kept sleeping with him.)
And now?
He's probably dancing somewhere.

"I just want to dance," he said
Heart on the floor, heels overhead
He disappeared in dawn's last chance
No goodbye, just one more dance
Phill and I, just sitting there
Watching silence fill the air
The music stopped, the lights went red
And that was the end of Alfie's thread

She was leasing dreams at Memorial Heights
Bubbly voice, clipboard tight
Said "sign here," then sipped my drink
By the third shot, she didn't blink

Introduced her to the crew one night
She tossed her purse and screamed in delight
Phill was shook, we all agreed:
"This girl's a walking legacy"

One hand in the air, top off, don't care
Kicking strangers out the club while her boobs were bare
She was sweet, she was wild, queen of every affair
Emilie, Emilie — best girl ever, we swear

She made out for cab fare (or so she thought)
Got double charged — justice forgot
Tried Islam on a Wednesday, lesbian by Thursday
Came out at Thanksgiving, left Valeria in a month, maybe

Pets galore, emotional zoo
Jack's ate his fur — what could we do?
She said "I'm the bouncer!" while falling down stairs
We just laughed, cuz that's Emily's flair

One hand in the air, shirt off, no shame
Making out with the bartender, forgetting his name
From leasing awards to naked despair
Emilie, Emilie — best girl ever, we swear

But seasons change, and chaos sleeps
She packed up the pain and found some peace
Now she hums in parks, plays crystal tones
Doing soundbaths solo, healing on her own

One hand in the air, now it's calm and clear
She traded clubs for chakras and says she's sincere
From blurred bars to soundwaves, she's breathing fresh air
Emilie, Emilie — still the best girl ever, we swear

"She used to scream in stilettos.
Now she whispers with singing bowls.
And somehow — it's still iconic.

Noche normal, tragos con Taca
Risas falsas, todo se acaba
Entramos al club, South Beach brillaba
Y algo entre tú y yo… explotaba

No sé por qué, no sé por quién
Tus palabras, mis enojos, y el desdén
Saliste corriendo, no quise parar
Te alcancé… y te hice tropezar

Te rompí el brazo, pero no el corazón
No sabíamos, solo fue la emoción
Tú con tu yeso, yo con el rencor
Ignorándonos bajo el mismo neón
Hasta que un día en Crocker Bar
Volvimos a hablar… sin tener que explicar

Brunch con Archer, mimosas sin fin
Mensaje de Yousef, y fue el fin
"Estamos en urgencias, ¿dónde están?"
Pero era tarde, estábamos mal

Taxi sin pago, casi nos matan
Corrimos del lío como dos ratas
Y tú con tu novio, herido, callado
Yo en el club, fingiendo que no ha pasado

Te rompí el brazo, pero no el corazón
No sabíamos, solo fue la emoción
Tú con tu yeso, yo con el rencor
Ignorándonos bajo el mismo neón
Hasta que un día en Crocker Bar
Volvimos a hablar… sin tener que explicar

Tus ojos decían lo que tus labios no
Que aún quedaba algo entre tú y yo
No amor… solo historia
Y una amistad que ni el drama destroza

Te rompí el brazo, pero no el corazón
Y aunque dolió… no fue el fin, mi amigo
Tú con tu yeso, yo con mi error
Y ahora seguimos, como antes, mejor
Porque lo real… sobrevive el dolor
Te rompí el brazo — pero no el corazón

He found him small, with eyes so wide
A Bengal soul, pure golden light
Through every move, through love and pain
he stayed close through storms and change

From Houston's heat to Cali air
He curled up soft, just always there
A quiet friend, a beating heart
The kind that knows you from the start

Oh Piggies, more than just a name
He wasn't "just a pet," not even close
He held the space, the passing years
He stayed when others disappeared
Now Kibis waits by the window sill
Still searching for his brother's will
And every day that passes near
Is proof that Piggies…
He was here

He nursed him through those final days
When light grew thin and legs gave way
The liver failed, the sight went dim
But love kept surging out from him

And when the message finally came
It held no blame, it named no pain
Just: "He's not good" — and nothing more
But silence says what we adore

Oh Piggies, more than fur or breath
A presence large enough to stretch beyond his death
He stayed through breakups, beds and walls
He caught the tears when no one called
Now Kibis walks where Piggies lay
Still listening in that gentle way
And every moment, year to year
Remembers Piggies…
He was here

No child, but he was loved as one
His memory burns like morning sun
They built a life, they made a home
And even now… he's not alone

Oh Piggies, rest where pain can't reach
But your soft grace still has much to teach
You showed what unconditional means
In snuggled nights and soft routines
Now Kibis watches with patient grace
Still waiting for your spirit's trace
And every time we hold back tears
It's just because…
You were here

Flew in for a weekend, hadn't seen him in a while
Leslie's bridal shower, Palm Springs in style
Met his friends for the first time
Tried to shine a little too bright

Sipped too fast, nerves took the wheel
Said too much, forgot what was real
Called them all tens — but not quite all
Then laughed too loud and watched myself fall

And no one apologized, but I cried
Drank the moonlight, said goodbye
Woke up lost in a stranger's score
That weekend turned into folklore
I was the moment, I was the mess
Jessica kissed me, cleared the rest
A little too much, but still sincere
Palm Springs apology tour — year after year

Phill was quiet, I said "Arash"
Didn't know the night had crashed
Leslie's laugh turned into doubt
And I blacked in while getting iced out

Drag queens danced, I took the pill
Thought I was dying on that hill
Made my goodbyes to the sky above
And Jessica said, "You're enough."

And no one apologized, but I cried
Said I'm sorry with my pride
Felt like shame in a desert room
But healing came in a kiss, not a broom
I was the noise, I was the light
And somehow still not quite alright
But love came back like it always does
Palm Springs apology — all because

I should've been held, not judged
I should've been met with love
But therapy taught me how to bend
And Phill, he always comes back again

No one apologized… but I've let go
The desert keeps what it needs to know
We laugh now when the topic appears
A messy memory through the years
Still the best of friends, still my core
Even after my
Palm Springs
Apology Tour

Yeah, yeah — oh, he's still here
Still ours. Still real.
Uncle Phill.

From wild nights to morning light
From Houston sparks to Cali skies
He's been the one, he's been the thread
The loudest laugh, the softest bed

He shows up with that steady calm
In every storm, in every song
Not loud for show, not chasing fame
But baby, we all know his name

He's got that timing, got that spark
Turns every moment into art
He's not the center — but he shines
He's been my brother through all time

We love Uncle Phill — say it true
Not just for what he says or do
But how he stays, how he stands tall
He's been the heart behind it all
We love Uncle Phill — and it shows
From inside jokes to midnight calls
Still got that edge, still got that thrill
And yeah, we love Uncle Phill

He laughs with Rob, they get along
Plays with the kids, but keeps it strong
He's part of everything we've grown
A name engraved inside our home

The sparkle's never just for fun
It's who he is when day is done
He holds our memories in his hands
And keeps us grounded where we stand

No script, no role, no guide to play
But somehow he shows up each day
With open arms and stories long
He's been the root — we've grown on

We love Uncle Phill — that's the truth
He's got the soul, he's got the proof
No need for spotlight, never will
He's our forever, Uncle Phill
We love Uncle Phill — no pretend
He's more than chosen, he's the end
Of every fear and every doubt
He's what this life's been all about

Uh —
Call him steady, call him cool
Never played by any rule
Godfather but not for show
He's the real one, now you know

Got that loyalty, got that grace
Walks in peace, but owns the space
No cape, no crown — but still that guy
Friend for life, and that's no lie

We love Uncle Phill — like a flame
Flickering joy, never the same
From laughs to tears, from fight to still
We ride or die for Uncle Phill
We love Uncle Phill — this is fact
Always forward, never back
No other bond could fit this bill
Forever love…
Uncle Phill.

We've been wild, we've been wrong
We've been loud, we've been strong
From city nights to morning light
You've had my back this whole damn ride

We've made mistakes, we've talked too much
We've shown up late, we've lost some trust
But through it all, one thing is true
I always know I've got you

And I'm still here, I always will be
Through every high, through every heavy
We've come so far, and we still stand
Not just a friend — you're part of my fam
Whatever comes, whatever's new
You've got a brother — I've got you

From heartbreak nights to wedding days
From blacked-out bars to quiet praise
We've been through storms, we've been through grace
You're one of the few I'd never replace

You've met my world, you've held my kids
Laughed with my husband, danced through this
You're not by blood, but through and through
You're my brother — that much is true

And I'm still here, I always will be
Through every joy, through every "you'll see"
We've come so far, and we still rise
You're in my circle for all my life
Whatever storms still come in view
You've got a brother — I've got you

No script for this, just time and heart
We've built something that won't fall apart
And if the world forgets our names
You'll still be in my hall of fame

Yeah, I'm still here, I always will be
In every laugh, in every memory
We've come so far, we're still not through
This is forever — me and you
Whatever life decides to do
You've got a brother —
I've got you

Still here.
Always will be.
Brother for life.

He shuffled under neon beams,
A backwards cap, soft eyes unseen.
Waco boy with fire inside,
Quiet heart he tried to hide.

Found his way through smoky nights,
Club lights flash, but something's tight.
A borrowed world, a borrowed dream,
A love too big to fit the seams.

He said yes before he broke,
With every light, another smoke.
They danced through nights that wouldn't last,
But love like that still haunts the past.

L.A. came, and so did doubt,
He changed his shape, he phased him out.
Faith and shame in silent war,
Locked the door but left it sore.

And when he left, he left it clean,
No scream, no fight, no final scene.
Just yoga mats and softer friends,
The love was gone, but not the end.

A heartbreak born from something true,
A boy who helped him see it through.
No vows remain, no picture frame,
But Phill, he rose up from the flame.

Still friends, still breath, but not the same—
Just the echo of his name.

Greenway heat, poolside glow
Laughter loud, the cocktails flow
Jealous glances, subtle shift
The kind of day that starts with bliss

Rob was new, the vibe was bright
But one wrong look set off the spark
Back at home, the voices soared
And then — the bottle hit the floor

Hot sauce on the tile, glass in the air
No one saw it coming — drama everywhere
Phill caught the spark, straight to the skin
It burned like fire, and that's where it begins

Valentina, on the floor
Broken glass and open doors
Heat and hurt, but we survived
Now we laugh, we're still alive
Valentina, sting and scar
Some wild times show you who you are

Rob storms out, but left his keys
Came back in like a storm at sea
Words were said, but hearts held fast
Even hot sauce pain won't last

It wasn't perfect, but it's real
A wild fight, a cut to heal
From salty wounds to wedding rings
From yelling loud to better things

Valentina, on the floor
Broken glass and open doors
Heat and hurt, but we survived
Now we laugh, we're still alive
Valentina, sting and scar
Some wild times show you who you are

Now there's kids and morning light
Uncle Phill still shining bright
One wild night we can't forget
A little pain, no regret

Valentina…
some bottles break, but hearts don't end
